  <h1>What is Permanent Residency?</h1>
    <p> Permanent residency is a person's legal resident status in a country or territory of which such person is not a citizen but where they have the right to reside on a permanent basis </p>

      <h1>What are the benefits of Permanent Residency?</h1>
      <p> If you become a Permanent Resident of Japan, you will have many more benefits than those living on temporary residence status, such as: </p>
      <li> You no longer have to renew or extend your visa. The status of Japan Permanent Residency is valid indefinitely.</li>
      <li> You still have to renew your Residence Card every seven years and get a Japan Re-Entry Permit if you will leave the country for longer than 1 year, but those are just formalities.</li>
      <li> You can work for any employer you want, and you donâ€™t have to apply for a change of your residency status if you will engage in different activities. In short, you can do any activity you like (as long as it is legal, of course).</li>
      <li> You can get a loan from a Japanese bank.</li>
      <li> You get better access to public housing.</li>
